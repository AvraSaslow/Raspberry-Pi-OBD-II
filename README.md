Application Name: PocketOBD

**Description:**
OBD-II is a standard communication protocol that most automobile manufacturers use to troubleshoot and read data from their vehicles. It has been the standard protocol since $1996$, and is used by dealerships and technicians to read data from the onboard computer. OBD-II scanners are quite expensive, ranging anywhere from $\$ 60$ to $\$ 400$.  While the specifications are not open-source, there are online resources that have enough information about the standard that it should be possible to reverse engineer the signals. We plan on creating a home-brew scanner from a Raspberry Pi that hosts information on a local server, which can be accessed through a WiFI module from any device.  This scanner should be able to read common signals from the OBD-II port and translate that to a graphical interface that is accessible from an internet browser.

**Vision Statement:**
For automotive tinkers who need a flexible OBD-II scanner for unique use cases. The Raspberry Pi OBD-II scanner is a OBD-II scanner that is customizable and open-source. Unlike most others on the market, the firmware is open-source and the overall cost is much less.
